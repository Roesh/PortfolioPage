        <p>If user is not logged in:
        Dislay nothing but display a login form and information about the project tracker
    
        A different url should be linked from the portfolio page. That URl should take users to a summary of Roshan's projects.
        All my projects will be public. 

        That page should have a link to a "Try it yourself" page, which will be this page!
