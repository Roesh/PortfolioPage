Roshan's portfolio page. Uses ASP.NET to dynamically generate pages. Meant to be hosted at roshan.page

Will showcase my projects and also serve my projects

roshan.page/ProjectTracker hosts my project tracker application.

I may also think of other projects, such as a calendar app or time management app. When creating those projects, I can add data about their progress to the main project tracker application.

I can also track progress on things like server setup or upload information about past projects like the mail server I created and the lessons I learned from it.

//POTENTIAL TODO: in appsettings.json (because comments are not permitted in JSON) see if the default connection can go into an environment variable
