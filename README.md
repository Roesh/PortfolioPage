Will showcase my projects and also serve my projects

Visit https://roshan.page/ProjectTracker/Project?user=RoshanJM to see the application in action.

I may also think of other projects, such as a calendar app or time management app. When creating those projects, I can add data about their progress to the main project tracker application.

I can also track progress on things like server setup or upload information about past projects like the mail server I created and the lessons I learned from it.

Do NOT commit secrets; use the secret store and environment variables.
